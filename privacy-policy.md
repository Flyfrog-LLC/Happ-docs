# Privacy Policy

Services provided by **Happ**, a product of **Flyfrog LLC**, are intended for use as is. This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service. If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible in individual apps unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

**VPN DATA**\
We DO NOT collect or store any VPN data.\
We DO NOT modify the contents of your VPN data.\
We DO NOT share any sensitive or user-specific data with third parties.

Happ is a non-centralized VPN app with users connecting to their own custom configured servers and doesn’t provide any centrally controlled servers for now. This means you as a user connecting to your own server do have complete control and liability over your VPN data. The app itself will not in any way modify any VPN data as it leaves the device to your configured VPN server.

**DATA COLLECTION**\
Happ collects and transmits only crash reports and application diagnostics data.\
Crash data may include:

* the number of app crashes
* stack traces or other error-related information

Analytical data may include information such as the amount of time a user spends on a specific screen. This data is collected and transmitted via Sentry, which helps us improve the app by identifying and resolving bugs and crashes. Personally identifiable information is not collected or shared.

Additionally:

* On **Android**, the app collects and stores a hardware identifier (HWID) and the push notification token required to deliver push notifications to the user's device.
* On **iOS**, the app requests the user’s permission to send push notifications before collecting the push notification token. If the user declines, push notifications will not be sent and no push token will be collected.

By default, the app also sends a unique device identifier (HWID) and the device model in HTTP headers when requesting subscription data (e.g., to fetch the list of servers). This information is used as a custom user identifier to support subscription functionality and connection management. Users can disable HWID transmission in the app settings. If disabled, the HWID will no longer be sent with requests to the server.

**ADVERTISING NETWORKS**\
Happ does not use monetization and has no plans for it in the future.

**CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**\
Happ does not collect any personally identifiable information from anyone, whether child or adult. This means no personally identifiable information is collected from children under 13.

**LINKS TO OTHER SITES**\
This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**\
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
