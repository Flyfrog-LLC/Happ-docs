# Share Configuration

You can share a server from a subscription (if it is not encrypted or hidden) or from the local server list. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Swipe right on the header of the desired server.
2. After swiping, two icons will appear. Tap on the purple icon with the arrow to choose the sharing option.
3. In the menu that appears, you will see three options:
   * **Copy to Clipboard**
   * **QR Code**
   * **JSON**

Select the desired option to share the configuration.
