<summary>Android TV</summary>

Setting up a system-wide proxy on Android TV can vary by model and version. Unfortunately, unlike Android on phones and tablets, Android TV often lacks built-in proxy configuration options in Wi-Fi settings. As a result, you may need to use third-party applications or configure the proxy individually in each app (if supported).

**Steps to Check for Built-In Proxy Settings:**

1. Open the **Settings** on your Android TV.
2. Navigate to **Network** or **Wi-Fi**.
3. Select your connected Wi-Fi network.
4. Look for proxy-related options such as "Proxy Settings." If available, you can enter the **IP Address** and **HTTP Port** here.

#### Configuring SOCKS Proxy for Specific Applications (e.g., Firefox)

If you need a proxy for a single application, configuring it directly in the app is the simplest approach.

**Firefox Example:**

1. Open **Firefox**.
2. Go to **Settings** (three horizontal lines in the top-right corner) → **General**.
3. Scroll to **Network Settings** and click **Settings...**.
4. Choose **Manual Proxy Configuration**.
5. In the **SOCKS v5** field, enter the **SOCKS Host** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) and the **Port** (e.g., `10809`).
6. Click **OK**.

#### Other Applications

Some applications may also have built-in proxy settings. Check the settings of the specific app you are using to see if a proxy can be configured directly.
